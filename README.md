# ML Mini-Projects
Some mini-projects I've done for practicing my skills in Python ML related libraries, not mathematically rigiorous. For well-structured projects, please visit my another repo. 
They were written in jupyter notebook format, it's easy for demonstration. You may use them as reference.
Please find libraries involved below:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit Learn
- Tensorflow with Keras
