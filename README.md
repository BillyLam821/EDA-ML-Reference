# ML Mini-Projects
Some mini-projects I've done using Python ML related packages, not mathematically rigiorous. For well-structured projects, please visit [my another repo](https://github.com/BillyLam821/Machine-Learning-Projects/).
They were written in jupyter notebook, that's easier for demonstration and my future reference.

Below are Libraries involved:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit Learn
- Tensorflow with Keras
